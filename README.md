# cache-simulator

üßë‚Äçüíª Role
Systems Programming Student / Cache Simulator Developer

üñ•Ô∏è Environment
Language: C

Platform: Unix/Linux

Tooling: GCC, Valgrind for trace generation

Libraries: <getopt.h>, <math.h>, <stdio.h>, <limits.h>

Output handler: cachelab.h (provided for summary reporting)

üß† Skills
Systems programming in C

Bit manipulation and memory addressing

Implementation of LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy

Parsing and replaying memory access traces

Dynamic memory allocation and management

Use of structs and multi-dimensional arrays

Debugging and testing memory simulation behavior

CLI argument parsing using getopt

‚öôÔ∏è Process
Parsed memory trace files generated by Valgrind to simulate memory access events (L, S, M)

Extracted set index and tag from memory addresses using bitwise operations

Implemented an LRU cache using 2D arrays of cache_line structs, each storing validity, tag, and LRU counter

Designed logic to detect cache hits, misses, and evictions for each memory operation

Ensured correct eviction behavior by maintaining a time-based LRU counter for each line

Supported verbose output for detailed trace of cache actions

Freed dynamically allocated memory after simulation to avoid leaks

üìà Outcome
Achieved accurate tracking of cache hits, misses, and evictions

Fully compliant with CS:APP cachelab autograder requirements

Gained strong understanding of cache design principles, memory hierarchy, and LRU policy

Solidified skills in low-level systems programming, making you well-prepared for roles involving OS, compilers, or embedded systems
